# Reinforcement Learning Problems: 
This repository shares my learning journey in the field of Reinforcement Learning.

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning which allows an AI agent to learn from it's surrounding (or environment) by interacting with it. It is kind of a trail and error learning. Each successful action leads to a positive reward, or a negative reward in another case. The agent goes through a series of actions and gains an overall reward for the whole duration of interacting with the environment.

The **OpenAI gym** provides many standard environments for people to test their Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
